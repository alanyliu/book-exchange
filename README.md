# book-exchange
Created by Alan Liu, former co-leader of the BISV Book Exchange. 

Start Date: Dec. 2021

## Description:
The Java Gradle project extrapolates key pricing information to work toward automating the required textbook purchasing process at BISV by reading in data and/or book ISBNs from a Google sheets master book list and web scraping from BookFinder. The extracted information may give useful insights into setting prices for books, as well as storing data for future purposes to avoid the need for manual price setting. Increased efficiency in the backend of the book transaction process will help the Book Exchange raise funds more effectively for the school supplies drive, which donates supplies to schools across the Bay Area of California.
