Start Date: Dec. 2021

Alan Liu, Co-founder of the BISV Book Exchange

Description:
This project seeks to automate the book purchasing process of textbooks at BISV by reading in data from Google sheets and scraping prices and book information off of BookFinder. Increased efficiency in book data storage automation will help the Book Exchange raise funds more effectively for the school supplies drive, which donates supplies to Alum Rock schools in California.

This project uses the following modules:
  - pandas
  - requests
  - BeautifulSoup

Data in format of pandas DataFrame data structure. Goal for methods for setting price should allow for both manual and automated (from scraping) input.
