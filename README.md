# book-exchange
Created by Alan Liu, Co-founder of the BISV Book Exchange. 

Start Date: Dec. 2021

## Description:
This project overall seeks to automate the book purchasing process of textbooks at BISV by reading in data from Google sheets and scraping prices and book information off of BookFinder with Python. The current goal is to extrapolate data that may give useful insight into textbook price setting and store data for future purposes. Increased efficiency in book data storage automation will help the Book Exchange raise funds more effectively for the school supplies drive, which donates supplies to Alum Rock schools in California.
